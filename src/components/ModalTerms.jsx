          Here is everything you need to know about purchasing and using our
          residential Green Waste collection services ordered through our
          website or in person.*

        <h3>1.    Making orders</h3>
        <p>
          When you place an order with us, you agree to use our services on a
          regular, ongoing basis until you cancel in accordance with clause 6. 
          You will need an email address that you check regularly, as this is
          the preferred option for communication.
        </p>
        <h3>2.    Delivering your Bin or Bag</h3>
        <p>
          We will deliver your garden Bin or Bag on the next working day that we
          are in your suburb.
        </p>
        <h3>3.    Scheduled collections</h3>
        <p>
          We will empty your Bin or Bag on the scheduled collection date &amp;
          cycle that has been approved by you either by phone, email or through
          our website, unless we have notified you in advance that the date has
          changed. If your scheduled collection falls on a public holiday your
          collection day may change, your previous invoice will have a change of
          collection day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our missed or delayed collection policy is as follows:
          <br />

          without charge
          <br />

          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are wanting to use a free missed collection you need to contact
          the office by phone or email at least 24 hours prior to the next
          scheduled collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can change your collection frequency at anytime by contacting the
          office.
        </p>
        <h3>4.    Charges</h3>
        <p>
          Our price is determined by the service address you provided to us, so
          any change to your address may result in a different price being
          charged. Our prices include GST. We can also remove Christmas trees
          plus extra side rubbish at an additional fee. Extra side rubbish must
          be contained in a bag or a bin. No loose material will be taken.
        </p>
        <h3>5.    Payment</h3>
        <p>
          After you receive your Bin or Bag a $60 payment is required before the
          first collection, this advance payment goes onto your account and your
          collection charges are deducted from it, once you have used your $60,
          simply pay a further $60. Payments can be made by credit card,
          internet banking or automatic payment.
        </p>
        <h3>6.    Cancelling your service</h3>
        <p>
          You can end your service at any time via email or phone message after
          the initial $60 has been used. We will keep emptying your Bin or Bag
          until your prepaid period expires. No refund will be given if the
          service is cancelled before the $60 advance payment has been used.
        </p>
        <p>
          On cancellation you agree to allow us access to the property for the
          purpose of collecting and removing our Bin or Bag.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cancellation charge will apply on the day the garden bin or bag is
          removed. This applies even if the bin or bag is empty on removal.
        </p>
        <h3>7.    No access policy</h3>
        <p>
          If we are not able to collect/empty your Bin or Bag due to restricted
          access for example Bin or Bag is behind locked gates, dogs are running
          free or a vehicle is blocking access, please email or phone the office
          and we will collect the Bin or Bag on the next day we are in your area
          at no extra charge. You are allowed 1 collection in lieu per year
          otherwise a full collection charge will apply. Your following
          collection date will remain the same.
        </p>
        <h3>8.    Using and looking after your Garden Waste Bin or Bag</h3>
        <p>Please DO:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Put your Bin out by 7am on the day of your collection.</li>
          <li>
            Place your Bin on the grass verge or berm closest to where our
            collection vehicle passes, so the wheels are closest to your house
            and the lid is closest to the road. Make sure the bin is clear of
            trees and other obstructions like parked cars or street light poles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contain all the waste inside your Bin or Bag without letting it
            spill over, and ensure the lid is closed on the Bin or not over the
            top of the frame of the garden Bag.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure your Garden Waste Bin or Bag contains approved organic waste
            as outlined in clause 9 below. If your Bin is not out for collection
            on your scheduled collection day, our drivers will enter your
            property to collect it if they can gain access. Drivers will do this
            as an occasional courtesy, not as part of regular service. If you DO
            NOT want us to enter your property please notify us by email or
            phone, the collection charge will remain.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Please do NOT:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Light fires or place hot embers or hot ash in the Bin or Bag.</li>
          <li>
            Put any liquids or explosive, toxic, dangerous, hazardous or noxious
            materials in the Bin or Bag. This includes materials like asbestos,
            acids, solvents, paints, unwrapped broken glass, minerals, grease or
            cooking oil, or concrete.
          </li>
          <li>Fill the bin to overflowing.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>9.    Garden Waste</h3>
        <p>
          Please ensure your Garden Waste bin only contains approved organic
          waste.  We cannot accept, sand, grass sods, dirt or soil, rocks,
          household rubbish, newspaper, old compost, stumps or branches bigger
          than 100mm in diameter in the Garden Waste Bin or Bag. Bins or Bags
          containing any forbidden material will not be taken as this cannot be
          composted successfully. An additional charge will apply if forbidden
          material is found in the Bin or Bag.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can order extra collections in addition to your scheduled
          collections by contacting us in advance. These extra collections will
          be charged for at the rates applicable at the time. You will be
          informed of the scheduled date for extra collections in your area when
          you contact us.
        </p>
        <h3>10.    Bin &amp; Bag Placement</h3>
        <p>
          Please ensure the Garden Waste Bin or Bag is NOT in a difficult
          position such as steep driveways, narrow access ways and steps that
          may impede the driver&rsquo;s ability to empty the Bin or Bag,
          resulting in a non-service. Unlock gates and tie up or secure dogs
          away from the Bin or Bag location.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to refuse our collection service to any property
          where the site is deemed by us to be unsafe.
